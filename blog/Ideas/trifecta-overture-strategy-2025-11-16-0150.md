# Trifecta Overture Publishing Strategy 
**Date:** November 16, 2025**  
**Time:** 1:50

---

## 1. Purpose
Establish a powerful re-entry for Vladimír’s consulting identity through a three-post publishing strategy (“trifecta overture”). This sequence communicates evolution, depth, continuity, and senior-level engineering maturity.

This creates:
- Initial consulting credibility
- A clean narrative arc from past to present
- Proof of long-term experience
- A foundation for premium (€512 / €1024) consulting positioning

---

## 2. Structure of the Trifecta
### **1. The New Article — Evolution Story**  
**Working title:** *"From Raspberry Pi Router to Zero-Trust Private Cloud: My Evolution as a Systems Architect"*

This post:
- Reflects on past work
- Introduces the 2025 sovereign infrastructure rebuild
- Shows maturity and growth
- Expressions lessons learned
- Bridges old content with the new direction
- Positions Vladimír as a senior systems architect

It references the two legacy posts to complete the story.

---

### **2. Updated Legacy Post — Raspberry Pi as Home Router**
Polish and republish the original article:
- Add a short 2025 introduction
- Explain its historical relevance in your journey
- Mention its limitations today
- Link to the evolution article

This becomes the "origin piece" of the story.

---

### **3. Updated Legacy Post — WireGuard Article**
Revise and republish the WireGuard post:
- Clean technical phrasing
- Add a 2025 commentary on WireGuard’s continued relevance
- Link back to the evolution article

This becomes the "foundational technology" piece.

---

## 3. Publishing Order
1. **Publish the new evolution article first** (the anchor)
2. **Publish the updated Raspberry Pi router article**
3. **Publish the updated WireGuard article**

Creates a narrative arc:
- Roots → Foundation → Modern Sovereignty

---

## 4. Strategic Impact
The trifecta overture:
- Demonstrates long-term engineering capability
- Provides concrete proof of expertise for consulting clients
- Helps justify premium pricing tiers (€512 and €1024)
- Strengthens the founder narrative
- Sets up future deep-dive infrastructure posts
- Signals a new chapter in the consulting identity

---

## 5. Workflow for the Coming Week
- Write the new evolution article during infrastructure planning
- Polish the two legacy posts with minor updates
- Publish in staggered order over a few days or within one week
- Cross-post on LinkedIn to maximize visibility

This fits perfectly into the upcoming infrastructure rebuild week, requiring minimal additional effort.
