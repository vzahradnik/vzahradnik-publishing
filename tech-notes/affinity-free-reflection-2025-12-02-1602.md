# Reflection — Why I Won’t Use Affinity Even Though It’s Free
**Date:** 2025-12-02 16:02

## The Idea to Be Archived

Affinity recently announced that their entire suite — Designer, Photo, Publisher — is now **100% free** after being acquired by Canva. While this created excitement across the design community, it also reveals a deeper strategic insight relevant to founders, professionals, and anyone building sovereign workflows.

This document captures the core strategic angle for a future post:

## Working Title
**Affinity Is Now Free — Why I Still Won’t Use It**

## Core Thesis
What appears to be generosity is actually a strategic acquisition funnel. "Free" software is rarely free — and professional founders should analyze the long-term implications rather than celebrate the price drop.

Affinity becoming free triggers several red flags:
- Loss of independence due to corporate ownership
- Market distortion caused by subsidized products
- Increased platform risk for professionals
- Long-term instability of a product line that no longer directly generates revenue
- The influx of hobbyists and resulting dilution of the ecosystem and quality

This makes Affinity unsuitable for long-term professional workflows — especially for those optimizing for sovereignty and stability.

## Key Angles for the Future Post

### 1. **“Free” Means Your Workflow Became a Strategic Funnel**
Canva now owns millions of designers' toolchains.
This is not charity — this is lock-in through generosity.

### 2. **Free Tools Kill Specialist Ecosystems**
When a giant makes something free, independent developers can't compete.
This is anti-fragility in reverse.

### 3. **Lack of Financial Incentive = Roadmap Uncertainty**
A product that earns no direct revenue is one meeting away from a strategic pivot.
Professionals cannot rely on such fragility.

### 4. **Price Is Irrelevant — Stability Is Everything**
Professionals do not pay for tools.
They pay for the guarantee that their tools will still exist.

### 5. **For Founders: Tool Independence Is a Survival Skill**
This ties into the Ravenville ethos of technological sovereignty — not being dependent on external whims.

## Positioning Benefits
Writing this post will:
- Reinforce the trajectory of *founder-level insights*
- Avoid positioning as a tech or design reviewer
- Strengthen credibility among product leaders, CTOs, and consultants
- Build alignment with Ravenville's values: sovereignty, stability, intentional systems

## Notes for Future Development
- Should be released on LinkedIn Pulse + regular LI post
- Add gentle personal examples: workflows, migrations, stability requirements
- Compare with Adobe’s predictability, Blackmagic’s model, etc.
- Do NOT frame it as an attack — frame it as strategic clarity
