They invented unbreakable glass. But it was too good.

In 1970s East Germany, scientists created a glass 15× stronger than normal — virtually unbreakable. They believed it would change the world.

It never made it to market.

Why? Because if glass never breaks, cafés, bars, and restaurants stop buying replacements. Durability is bad business.

The lesson? Our entire economy is addicted to breakability. Phones, furniture, tools, even software — all designed for fast death or replacement.

Some of us believe this can change.

We don’t build to scale fast. We build to last.
