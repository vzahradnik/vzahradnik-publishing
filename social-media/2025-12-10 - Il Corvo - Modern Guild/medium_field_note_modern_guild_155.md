# *Field Note*: The Modern Guild — and Why People Should Work on More Than One Thing

## The Modern Guild — A High‑Level Blueprint

One of the most misunderstood ideas in my organizational operating system is the notion that people in a company can — and should — contribute to more than one domain. Not through chaos, overwork, or scattered attention, but through *designed modularity*.

This Field Note distills the concept into something practical, adaptable, and clear.

## 1. Why the Modern Guild Exists

The classic advice for founders and professionals is simple: *focus on one thing*. But for many generalists — myself included — this advice is not only unhelpful but unnatural.

Across my career, no matter how narrowly I tried to define myself, my work always expanded. My LinkedIn presence is a perfect example: it began as a purely tech‑consultant persona. Then Arduino. Then organizational design. Then culture and philosophy. My full range inevitably surfaced.

Only recently did I realize:
> My business *is* the product — and it is inherently multi‑domain.

This realization is foundational for the modern guild.

## 2. How Multi‑Domain Work Actually Functions

A modern guild is not built around a single specialization. It is built around **modular competence**.

People have:
- one *primary domain* (their anchor), and
- one or more *secondary domains* (their growth edges).

This is not multitasking.
This is not context‑switch burnout.
This is not "do more with less."

This is *structured versatility.*

Even a traditional startup with a single product can benefit from this model:
- An engineer spends 80% in engineering and 20% learning product design.
- A marketer spends 80% in campaigns and 20% learning analytics.
- A founder rotates across domains but documents systems to stay sane.

The key idea is simple:
> People grow by contributing to more than one thread — without losing their center.

## 3. Why Multiple Verticals Create Stability

My strongest realization came from studying cultural industries.

The projects I care about the most — film, theater, storytelling, cultural preservation — are often the *least profitable*. Historically, culture shapes societies but rarely pays the bills.

So the modern guild must compensate structurally.

My approach:
### **A multi‑vertical architecture with cross‑subsidization.**
- A few boring but high‑margin businesses generate financial "fuel."  
- That fuel is reinvested into cultural verticals that require long‑term vision.
- The entire system becomes *self‑balancing.*

Stability through diversity.  
Breadth without collapse.  
A portfolio that protects its own fragility.

## 4. You Don’t Need My Model. You Need *Your* Model.

I offer my guild blueprint not as doctrine but as an invitation.

Every founder, leader, or builder must adapt it to their own context. Your people, your market, your capabilities — these define your architecture.

What matters is not having multiple verticals.  
What matters is designing a system where your people can operate at their highest potential.

If that means:
- a single product with cross‑disciplinary roles — good.
- a multi‑product ecosystem with shared talent — good.
- a hybrid — good.

The point is freedom, not prescription.

## 5. Closing Reflection

I created this blueprint because the world treats generalists as unfocused. In truth, they are **bias‑free innovators**, capable of weaving threads across domains.

In a modern guild, this becomes a strength — not a liability.

And if we build organizations that honor this way of working, we may discover that the next generation of great companies will come not from rigid hierarchies but from fluid, modular, domain‑spanning guilds.
