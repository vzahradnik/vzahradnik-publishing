**Global Talent, High Standards — Hiring for a Modern Guild**  
**December 4, 2025 — 17:07**

One of the biggest advantages of building a **modern guild** instead of a traditional company is this:

**Talent is global.  
My bar is high.  
And geography is no longer a constraint.**

From the start, my company will be decentralized. GitLab and other fully remote organizations proved that this model is not only possible — it can be sustainable and high-performance when designed intentionally.

## **Why My Talent Pool Is Global**
I’m not building a classic HQ-based company. I’m building a system where the *best people* can join, no matter where they live.

For example:
I recently discovered a potential future collaborator on Medium. He lives in Bangladesh. Just like me, he feels "too big for his region." I recognized that energy immediately.

These are the people I want: those who outgrow their local environment and are hungry for a place where their depth is seen.

If you resonate with this, keep reading — **my door is open**.

## **Remote-First, Presence-Second**
The guild will be:
- **virtual-office primary** (default),
- **physical-office secondary** (optional, but powerful).

Remote work ensures anyone, anywhere, can join. But the real magic will happen in physical guild centers — not daily, not bureaucratically, but when people with similar frequency work side by side on ambitious projects led by mastery.

Those environments transform apprentices into future masters.

## **Micro-Teams Make This Sustainable**
Everything I build relies on:
- small, autonomous teams,
- deep ownership,
- minimal hierarchy,
- and self-leadership.

This is a system that scales *horizontally*, not vertically. You don’t need 500 people to make something great. You need five people who care.

## **Guild Centers as Cultural Anchors**
While talent is global, I still plan physical branch offices — first in Central Europe, then internationally.

Each center will have:
- a primary specialization,
- a local craft identity,
- its own micro-culture,
- and its own masters and apprentices.

Think of them as studios or ateliers — not departments.

This is how the guild survives beyond me.

## **Not a Cult — a Sustainable System**
Long-arc visions can be misunderstood as ego journeys. But I am not building a cult or a personality-driven entity.

I’m building:
- a sustainable creative system,
- a self-renewing educational model,
- and a lineage of mastery.

If the system survives 50 years after me — even if my name doesn’t — then the mission succeeded.

This isn’t about legacy. It’s about continuity.

---

## **This Is Just the Beginning**
There is more to say about how these guild centers will coordinate, specialize, and evolve — but that is a topic for another day.

For now, the message is simple:

**The world is full of outliers waiting for the right place to grow.  
My role is to build that place.**
