**A Founder–Consultant — December 4, 2025, 13:06**

When you start a company, you always face a choice:
**How fast do you want to grow — and how much of yourself are you willing to sacrifice?**

I already shared that my timeframe is **30 years**, not five. I’m not rushing.

Early on, I made a deliberate decision to **bootstrap** my company. Not because investment is bad, but because my project has characteristics that make early VC money counterproductive.

## **Why I’m Not Raising Now**
- What I’m building is unusual; most VCs wouldn’t “get it” at this stage — I’d receive confusion instead of capital.
- I’d rather *build* than spend months pitching decks and simplifying my vision to fit someone else’s model.
- Seed rounds are often burned while founders are still figuring out their product. If I skip that phase and later present a profitable, stable business, I’ll get better terms and lose fewer shares.

So how do I fund the early stage without sacrificing ownership?

The answer is simple: **my mind**.

## **The Generalist Advantage**
To me, my thinking feels normal. But after speaking with founders and leaders across disciplines, I realized it’s not.

I’m a **generalist with depth** — someone who sees across systems, technologies, and narratives. I can look at a startup holistically, through:
- architecture
- engineering
- product
- positioning
- go-to-market
- storytelling
- team dynamics
- long-term viability

This is rare.

Ironically, in an interview earlier this year, the business owner asked:
> *“Switching projects and technologies is fun… but when will you mature and specialize?”*

I smiled.

**“Never.”**

Because the age of AI will be dominated by generalists — people who operate across boundaries, not in silos.

That’s why I decided to make my mind my first investor.

## **Founder First, Consultant Second**
I refuse to apply for any job expecting 40 hours a week — I’m already building my own long-arc venture.

Instead, I offer **targeted consulting**: a few hours of deep insight that move companies forward far more efficiently than full-time employment ever could.

My math is simple:
- If I can cover my lifestyle with **~10 hours of consulting per month**, I have the rest of the month to build my modern guild.
- If consulting demand reaches **up to 30 hours per month**, I can hire my closest collaborators full-time.

This is enough to produce the first real products. Once those products generate revenue, consulting becomes optional — and naturally, my hourly rate rises.

Because every hour spent advising someone else is an hour not spent building my own company.

## **This Is My Sustainable Funding Model**
No grind.
No dilution.
No sacrificing my life for a lottery ticket.

Just clarity, sovereignty, and long-term thinking.

If you resonate with this approach — we may end up working together one day.
