# **Field Notes — CPU Rings & the Architecture of a Modern Guild**

A flat hierarchy is my ideal — but even flat systems require layers of access. As an engineer, my mental model for this comes from CPU privilege rings. They map surprisingly well to leadership inside a modern, decentralized guild.

---

## **🔸 Ring 0 — Full Context (just me)**
I hold complete architectural visibility — the long-game direction, the structural blueprint, the continuity of vision. Ring 0 isn’t about control. It’s about stewardship.

---

## **🔸 Ring 1 — The Inner Circle**
A handful of deeply aligned collaborators.  
People who don’t just understand the mission — they *carry* it.

These are the individuals who help translate vision into systems, culture, and early traction.

---

## **🔸 Ring 2 — The Guild Members**
Most contributors operate here: autonomous, trusted, skilled.

This layer is about:
- mastery of craft,
- minimal bureaucracy,
- high ownership,
- independence without isolation.

Ring 2 is where the guild becomes real.

## **🔸 Ring 3 — The Public Interface (“The API Layer”)**
My inner engineer can’t resist this metaphor:  
Ring 3 is the **public API** of the guild.

It has two clear functions:

### **1️⃣ Customers**
People who will attend our conferences, buy our products, or interact with our ecosystem.

### **2️⃣ Other Founders — the Business API**
This is where scale happens.

If I want my organizational model to spread, it cannot be limited to one company. It needs to be *adopted*. And the most efficient way to spread a leadership model is not through bureaucracy — but through **aligned founders**.

> Mentor the CEOs, not the entire org chart.

One strong founder influences dozens.  
Ten strong founders can influence thousands.

---

## **The First Founder Is Already Inside the Circle**
I’ve already begun this process: mentoring one early-stage founder.  
My financial investment is symbolic compared to traditional angel funds, but the *alignment* is what matters.

This prototype will tell me everything I need to know.

If the model works, Ring 3 may one day include dozens of founders operating on:
- autonomy,
- micro-teams,
- sustainable pace,
- mastery over grind,
- long-game thinking.

This is impact without building a corporation of 10,000 people.

---

## **Closing Thought**
I won’t unpack the entire vision today, but the trajectory is clear:

I am quietly building a distributed, founder-aligned ecosystem —  
not a physical “valley,” but a **network of modern guilds**.

And the first node is already online.
