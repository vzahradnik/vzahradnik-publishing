# **Field Notes — Designing for After Death: A Founder’s Succession Model**

We all die. It’s a truth I first encountered at four years old — terrifying at the time, quietly accepted later. But as a founder, mortality eventually becomes more than a fact of life. It becomes **a design constraint**.

If you’re building something larger than yourself, something intended to outlive you, then death must be part of the long-term architecture.

And so I often ask myself:

### **What happens to my company after I’m gone?**

History offers a clear pattern.

## **Henry Ford and the Succession Trap**
Henry Ford understood something few founders ever master: the power of **thinking talent**. He paid brilliant people simply to ideate. It’s similar to how I operate — prioritizing minds, not just manpower.

But succession is where the story shifts.

Edsel Ford took over for a time. Then Henry Ford II. Both were capable leaders. Yet:

> **Neither would have built Ford Motor Company from scratch.**

They inherited a debt-free empire, flush with cash. But inheritance is not the same as vision.

Over time, Ford became the very thing Henry despised: a slow, bureaucratic machine.

A line from *Ford vs Ferrari* captures it perfectly:

> **“Your CEO is not Henry Ford. He is Henry Ford *the Second*.”**

Painful — and true.

It’s the story of many companies: brilliance in generation one, stagnation in generation two, decay in generation three.

## **Why Traditional Succession Fails**
Founder builds → family inherits → strategic drift → decline.

Not because families lack intelligence.  
But because a founder’s **internal compass** — their intuition, clarity, and narrative sense — cannot be inherited.

Once a company becomes simply a family asset, its edge weakens.

## **My Solution: Build for Sustainability, Not Inheritance**
I would love to remain CEO forever. But that option is unavailable.

So I designed a different endgame:

### **My for-profit company will transition into a non-profit foundation after I retire.**

Not soon — perhaps 30 years from now.

This gives me decades to:
- train successors,
- build a leadership pipeline,
- establish culture as the primary operating system,
- select future stewards based on **merit, integrity, and alignment**, not genetics.

A foundation structure prevents:
- ego-driven takeovers,
- bloodline succession mistakes,
- corporate sellouts,
- slow degradation after the founder’s death.

It doesn’t guarantee immortality.  
But it **gives the company a chance** — maybe 50 years, maybe 100, maybe longer.

## **I Am Designing for a World I Will Not See**
This is the essence of long-game thinking:

> **To build systems that will function long after you’re no longer here to guide them.**

Future generations will know the outcome.
I simply need to build the architecture.
