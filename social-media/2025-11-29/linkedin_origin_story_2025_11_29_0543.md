## A Career Fork — When Two Roads Collide

Most of us have faced a moment when life split in two directions.

For me, that fork appeared in 2006, during my final year of high school.

I’ve always had an artistic soul and an engineering mind.

For eight years I played the accordion — and I was good enough to consider a conservatory.  
At the same time, I was fascinated by transmission towers and geosynchronous satellites beaming signals to millions of homes across the world.

Even though I later became a software engineer, it wasn’t “programming” that drew me in.  
It was the beauty of **broadcasting** — invisible waves, antennas, and the quiet hum of electricity connecting people across distance.

And so I made a pragmatic decision.

If I chose the artist’s path, the odds of making a living were slim.  
The engineer’s path promised stability — and a different kind of creativity.

That choice shaped my life.  
Today, even if I’m no longer working directly in telecommunications, I still stop to admire every satellite dish I see. (Proof: scroll through my early posts — there’s one of me standing proudly beside one.)

Sometimes I wonder: *what if I’d taken the other road?*  
Maybe I’d have ended up as someone like **Lucio Corsi** — an outlier artist with a small but devoted following.

Instead, I became an engineer who discovered art inside technology — what Paul Graham once called “a hacker and a painter.”  
Over time, that blend became my signature.

My artistic side is happy now.  
I’m not building a soulless company — I’m shaping something artistic through engineering itself.

Because in the end, creation is creation — whether you use brushes or code.
