# **A Career Fork — When Two Roads Collide**

Most of us experience a moment when life splits in two directions — a fork that defines the next decade.

For me, that moment appeared in **2006**, during my final year of high school.

I’ve always had an **artistic soul** and an **engineering mind**.

For eight years I played the accordion — long enough, and well enough, to consider a conservatory.  
At the same time, I was obsessed with transmission towers, antennas, and geosynchronous satellites beaming signals across continents.

Even though I later became a software engineer, it wasn’t “programming” that drew me in.  
It was the beauty of **broadcasting** — invisible waves, antennas, and the quiet hum of electricity connecting people across distance.

And so I made a pragmatic decision.

If I chose the artist’s path, the chances of making a living were slim.  
The engineering path promised stability — and a different kind of creativity.

That choice shaped everything that followed.

Even today, long after leaving telecommunications, I still pause to admire every satellite dish I see.  
(Proof: scroll through my early posts — there’s one of me proudly standing beside one.)

Sometimes I wonder: *what if I’d taken the other road?*  
Maybe I’d be someone like **Lucio Corsi** — an outlier artist with a small but devoted following.

Instead, I became an engineer who discovered **art inside technology** — what Paul Graham called *a hacker and a painter*.

Over time, that blend became my signature.

My artistic side is happy now.  
I’m not building a soulless company — I’m shaping something artistic *through engineering itself*.

Because in the end, creation is creation — whether you use brushes or code.
