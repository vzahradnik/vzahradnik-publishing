AI companies are in an arms race — model vs. model, US vs. China, parameter count vs. parameter count.
Bigger, faster, smarter. Billions burned. Benchmarks crushed.

But here’s the uncomfortable truth:

Most users don’t need a better model. They need a better UI.

As a power user, I work with ChatGPT at a scale most people never touch:
– I create hundreds of canvas documents every month.
– I store them in Git as part of my personal knowledge base.
– OpenAI doesn’t support batch export, so I wrote my own script. (DM me if you want it.)


And in the process I realized something surprising:

I understand parts of OpenAI’s internal data architecture better than some OpenAI employees.

Not because I’m special —
but because their UI forces me to reverse-engineer everything.

Across platforms:
– Windows app → inconsistent
– Android app → sluggish
– Web UI → broken canvas previews, loading bugs, navigation hiccups
– File handling → non-existent batch operations


And all of this persists while OpenAI proudly releases GPT-5.1 as the new milestone…
…right after 5.0, which was already more than enough for 99% of users.

Yes, the model is incredible.
Yes, the tech is revolutionary.

But diminishing returns are real — especially when the user experience lags far behind the model experience.

What OpenAI (and the industry in general) seems to miss is simple:

The next leap isn’t bigger models.
It’s better UX, reliability, speed, and control.

Give us:
– stable canvas
– batch export
– real file management
– responsive UI
– predictable behavior
– public APIs for workspace automation


…and productivity would explode far more than with another 5% model improvement.

This critique is aimed mainly at OpenAI because it’s the tool I use every day.
I can’t judge competitors I don’t use at the same depth.

But the message applies broadly:

Stop optimizing benchmarks.
Start optimizing real humans.
