# **Why AI Needs Better UX — Not Bigger Models**
**Originally published on LinkedIn (reformatted for zahradnik.io / Medium)**

AI companies are locked in an arms race — **model vs. model, US vs. China, parameter count vs. parameter count**.

Bigger. Faster. Smarter. Billions burned. Benchmarks crushed.

But here’s the uncomfortable truth:

> **Most users don’t need a better model. They need a better UI.**

---

As a power user, I work with ChatGPT at a scale most people never touch:
- I create **hundreds of canvas documents** every month.
- I store them in **Git** as part of my personal knowledge base.
- OpenAI doesn’t support **batch export**, so I wrote my own script. *(DM me if you want it.)*

And in the process, I realized something surprising:

> **I understand parts of OpenAI’s internal data architecture better than some OpenAI employees.**

Not because I’m special —  
but because their **UI forces me to reverse‑engineer everything**.

---

Across platforms, the experience is inconsistent:
- **Windows app** → inconsistent  
- **Android app** → sluggish  
- **Web UI** → broken canvas previews, loading bugs, navigation hiccups  
- **File handling** → no batch operations, no structure

All of this while OpenAI proudly releases **GPT‑5.1** as the new milestone…  
…right after **5.0**, which was already more than enough for **99% of users**.

Yes — the model is incredible.  
Yes — the tech is revolutionary.

But **diminishing returns** are real when **UX lags behind model quality**.

---

What OpenAI (and the industry in general) seems to miss is simple:

> **The next leap isn’t bigger models — it’s better UX, reliability, speed, and user control.**

Give us:
- stable canvas
- batch export
- real file management
- responsive UI
- predictable behavior
- public APIs for workspace automation

…and productivity would skyrocket far more than with yet another 5% model improvement.

This critique is aimed mainly at OpenAI because it’s the tool I use every day.  
I can’t judge competitors I don’t use at the same depth.

But the message applies across the entire industry:

**Stop optimizing benchmarks.  
Start optimizing real humans.**
