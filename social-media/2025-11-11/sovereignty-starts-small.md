Sovereignty starts small.

When most startups begin, thinking about their data sits at the bottom of the priority list.
They rent services from other startups — buying comfort, but losing sovereignty.

I chose a different path.
From day one, I’ve been building a sovereign infrastructure:
a self-hosted server holding all company data, an off-site backup 400 km away, and open-source tools replacing paid SaaS one by one.
Piece by piece, freedom grows.

My philosophy is simple:
Instead of paying subscriptions per seat, I’ll fund open-source projects to build the features we need.

If you want to build something that lasts for decades, start with solid foundations.
