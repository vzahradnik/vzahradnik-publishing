# **Sovereignty Begins With Infrastructure**

Sovereignty starts small.

When most startups begin, **data strategy sits at the very bottom** of the priority list. They rent services from other startups — buying comfort, but slowly giving up control.

I chose a different path.

From day one, I’ve been building a **sovereign infrastructure**:
- a self-hosted server holding all company data,
- an off-site backup stored 400 km away,
- open-source tools replacing paid SaaS, one by one.

Piece by piece, freedom grows.

My philosophy is simple:

> Instead of paying subscriptions per seat, I’d rather **fund open-source projects** to build the features we actually need.

If you want to build something that lasts decades,  
you start with **solid foundations**.
