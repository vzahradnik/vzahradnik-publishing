🎮 Stop the Destruction of Video Games 🎮

More and more games are disappearing forever.

Ubisoft is delisting titles and revoking access post-purchase.

Some games require a connection to dead servers to even start.

Entire digital libraries can vanish overnight — with no legal recourse.

This is not a niche problem. It’s a massive cultural loss.
When publishers can revoke your access at will, you don’t own your games — you rent them.

This petition calls on the EU to protect player rights and ensure that purchased games remain functional and accessible, even after official support ends.

If you care about game preservation — or digital rights at large —
sign the petition and share it with others.

🎮 Games are not disposable content. They are art. Let’s preserve them.
