# A Geek Powered by Curiosity
**Timestamp: 2025-11-27**

**A geek powered by curiosity.**

My range is broad — and for most people that usually means lack of depth.  
But I hope my recent posts made one thing clear:

👉 **My depth matches my range.**

Today let’s put engineering and leadership aside.  
Let’s talk about my… unusual hobbies.

A few minutes ago, I watched a YouTube video where someone tried to install an antique Voodoo 2 GPU into Windows 11.

**Spoiler alert: he succeeded.**

Some absolute madman wrote a brand new Windows 11 driver by reverse-engineering the original 1990s Windows NT driver — and building an NT→Win11 API translation layer so the old DLLs still work.

This is where Paul Graham was right:  
**hackers and painters really are the same species.**

I’m one of the rare ones who sees code as art.

- The person who writes an NVMe SSD driver for Windows 2000  
- The one who builds a translation layer between operating systems  
- The hacker who resurrects dead hardware on a modern OS  

These people are *artists*.  
Their medium just happens to be logic, not oil paint.

And if I had Hermione’s Time-Turner, I’d spend entire days:

- reverse-engineering old binaries  
- building emulators for forgotten consoles  
- writing tiny tech demos that nobody asked for  

Because when I do projects like these, **ten hours feel like one**.

At my core, I am a hacker — and a painter — who decided to scale my curiosity upward and hack something larger:

**the world.**

That’s why I’m here.  
Not as a programmer anymore.  
But as a founder.

**Let’s hack the world for the better.**
