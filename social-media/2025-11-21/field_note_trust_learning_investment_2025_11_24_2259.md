# **Why I Fund Learning, Not Just Output**

Most companies pay strictly for **output**.  
They track every hour and optimize every minute around KPIs.

I decided to take a different approach.

A friend and part-time collaborator recently started exploring automation tools. Instead of limiting him to assigned tasks, I funded his **learning time** — even during periods when I didn’t have enough concrete work for him.

I pay him to study.  
To experiment.  
To build skills.

Could he leave one day? Yes.  
We don’t have a contract that binds him to me.

But investing in people is still the right strategy.

If I secure additional funding, I’ll continue allocating a portion toward **self-study and skill development**, no strings attached.

Because long-term growth doesn’t start with control.  
It starts with **trust**.
