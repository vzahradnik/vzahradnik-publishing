**Introducing a New Series: Why I Left Corporations**

Tomorrow, I’m releasing a LinkedIn Pulse article that marks the beginning of something I’ve been quietly shaping for years — a deeper look into how modern organizations actually work, and why so many fail the people inside them.

This first article is called **“Why I Left Corporations.”** It’s not a rant, not memoir, not therapy. It’s a structural critique — and the foundation for a broader framework I’ll be sharing over the coming days.

If you’ve followed my recent posts, you know I’m interested in the patterns beneath leadership, team dynamics, incentives, and sustainability. This series will dive into:
- The hidden mechanics that make corporate environments burn out top performers
- Why nonprofits get the leadership model right but the business model wrong
- What an alternative operating system could look like
- And yes — how founders and leaders can apply these ideas today

Think of this as the **prelude to a modular operating system for modern organizations.**

If you lead people, want to lead people, or simply want to understand why so many workplaces feel misaligned, I think you’ll find value in what comes next.

The first chapter drops tomorrow.
