**Introducing: Why I Left Corporations — Pulse Article Announcement**  
*December 6, 2025, 13:42*

Tomorrow I’m publishing something different — a piece I’ve been shaping for years, long before I realized it would become the foundation of the organizational system I now build.

It’s called **“Why I Left Corporations.”**

Not a rant. Not nostalgia. A structural diagnosis.

Corporate environments gave me valuable lessons, but they also revealed something deeper: a fundamental misalignment between how outliers operate and how corporations are designed. And if you’re someone who thinks differently, builds differently, or solves problems differently, you likely felt this tension too.

This article is the opening chapter to a short LinkedIn series where I outline:

- why traditional corporations struggle to harness outlier potential,  
- what we can learn from the non-profit leadership model,  
- and how a new hybrid architecture might work in practice.

I’m not proposing theory for theory’s sake. I’m proposing a **practical operating system** for modern teams — born from real experience, refined through consulting, and tested through years of work across disciplines.

If you’re a founder, leader, or someone simply curious about how organizations *could* work rather than how they’ve *always* worked, I think this series will resonate.

The first chapter goes live tomorrow.

Let’s see where it takes us.
