500 years ago, in the hills of Tuscany and the streets of Florence, something extraordinary began.
A ripple that would one day be called the Renaissance.

- A rediscovery of ancient wisdom
- A lifting of culture, art, and science to new heights
- A rising of the bar — to deliver the best that’s within us

Today, surrounded by noise, distraction, and the slow decay of meaning, I ask:

Is it not time for a new renaissance?

Not a return — but a reawakening.
Not nostalgia — but evolution.
