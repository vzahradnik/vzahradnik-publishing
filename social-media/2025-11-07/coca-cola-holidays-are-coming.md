Holidays are coming — and so is the famous Coca-Cola ad we’ve seen every year around this time.

Coca-Cola reportedly started cutting costs by generating AI reels. To me, that feels like a strange kind of efficiency: saving money by removing the human touch that built the brand in the first place.

Ironically, this parody of their official ad captures the spirit of modern marketing far better — chaotic, over-automated, and unintentionally funny.
