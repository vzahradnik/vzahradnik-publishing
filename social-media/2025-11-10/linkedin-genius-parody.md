**Title:** If the Geniuses Lived Today

Imagine a world where all the great minds of history were forced to live in the LinkedIn era — their brilliance condensed into posts, reactions, and carefully curated comment threads.

**Leonardo da Vinci ✈️**  
> "Reimagined flight dynamics. New propeller concept based on spiral motion of air. Sketch attached."

**Nikola Tesla finds this insightful.**  
**Albert Einstein celebrates it.**  
**Steve Jobs comments:** "The diagram seems crude and needs some polish."  
**Elon Musk comments:** "You’ve stolen my idea. I’ll outcompete you."  

**Michelangelo supports it:** "Beautiful lines, but could it be carved from marble?"  
**Isaac Newton reacts with curiosity:** "Saved for later. Still investigating gravity."  
**Anonymous commenter:** "Fake. AI-generated."

Leonardo sighs, closes the app, and mutters under his breath:

> "The machine was never meant for *likes*."

This is the modern paradox of creation: the platforms that promise visibility also trivialize vision. The flood of *finds this insightful*, *celebrates it*, and *supports it* creates a false sense of engagement — a chorus of validation that masks the silence of true understanding.

Real creators build cathedrals, not feeds.
