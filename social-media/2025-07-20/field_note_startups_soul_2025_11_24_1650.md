# **Why I Prefer Loyal Teams Over Hollow Startups**

Modern startups often feel **soulless**.

They begin with bold declarations — *“we’ll change the world,”* *“we’ll make a dent in the universe.”* But once growth accelerates, the story changes.

Users become numbers.  
Everything revolves around metrics:

- burn rate,
- ROI,
- customer acquisition costs.

And if the company is VC-funded, the founder’s real job is no longer to build — it’s to **manage investor expectations**.

Startups stop being built for impact.  
They’re built for **exit**.

I believe this model is broken.

Call me old-fashioned, but I want to measure success by something simpler:

**How many people stay.**

If someone works with me for ten years or more, that is success —  
not valuation, not speed, not vanity metrics.

I’d rather grow slowly — or stay intentionally small — than build another hollow corporation driven by pitch decks and pressure.

No boardrooms.  
No politics.  
No smiling faces hiding burnout.

Just real work.  
Real loyalty.  
Real legacy.
