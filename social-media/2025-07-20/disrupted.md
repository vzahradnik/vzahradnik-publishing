Modern startups often feel soulless.
They begin with bold words — “we’ll change the world,” “we’ll make a dent in the universe.”

But once growth kicks in, users become numbers.
Everything is about metrics: burn rate, ROI, customer acquisition cost.
If the startup is VC-funded, the founder’s job is no longer to build.
It’s to keep investors happy.

Startups aren’t built for impact.
They’re built for exit.

I believe this model is broken.
Call me crazy — but I want to measure success by how many people stay.
If someone works with me for 10 years or more, that’s success.
Not valuation. Not speed. Not vanity metrics.

I’d rather grow slow — or stay small — than build yet another hollow corporation.
No board. No politics. No smiling faces hiding burnout.

Just real work, real loyalty, real legacy.
