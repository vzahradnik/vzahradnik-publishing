Less is More — How Conferences Drifted from Signal to Noise

I’ve observed a pattern over the years.
A few enthusiasts start a small conference — web development, AI, game design, whatever their passion.
It’s focused, authentic, alive with signal.

Then it grows. Sponsors appear — Google, Meta, Microsoft… Developers, Developers, Developers.
The speakers shift from those who build to those who sell.
From craftsmen to celebrities.

Growth isn’t the problem — direction is.
Each year the hosts chase the same dragon: Bigger. Louder. Flashier. More influential. More expensive.
But not necessarily more meaningful.

Recently I attended a smaller event than Web Summit, yet the same pattern emerged.
Three days, two parallel tracks, ten hours of talks per day.
How much did I actually absorb? Two or three sessions daily — fully present, taking notes, thinking deeply.
That was enough. More would’ve been noise.

The paradox of choice hits hard.
The more speakers you have in parallel, the less signal you receive.
It’s like a dating app or an online marketplace — endless options, no depth.
You leave with selfies, hashtags, and overstimulation, but little clarity.

What if conferences were built differently?

One stage.
Few speakers.
Each chosen for depth, coherence, and presence — not follower count.
Each word weighted like music.

Less is more.
Signal beats noise.
