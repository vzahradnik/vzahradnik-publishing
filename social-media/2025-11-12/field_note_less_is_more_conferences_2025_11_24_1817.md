# **Less Is More: When Conferences Forget Their Purpose**
**Originally published on LinkedIn (reformatted for zahradnik.io / Medium)**

Conferences often begin small — driven by **passion**, **curiosity**, and **dialogue**.

But as they grow, something shifts.  
The focus drifts from *ideas* to *influence*, from *signal* to *noise*.

Bigger halls. Louder lights. Famous faces.  
And yet, the more they expand, **the less they transmit**.

People leave stimulated — but not transformed.

---

Some of us are quietly crafting a different kind of convergence.  
One that remembers **why** gatherings matter.

A space where every word, sound, and light serves the **message**, not the ego.

The next evolution of conferences won’t be louder.  
It will be **truer**.
