# **Ego vs. Clarity — You Can’t Have Both**

**You cannot have ego and clarity at the same time.**

Over the years, I noticed a pattern:  
when someone’s **ego is loud**, their perception becomes distorted — internally and externally. It becomes harder to see reality as it is.

I’ve seen it manifest in many forms:
- A scientist who spent **10 years** on a research path that went nowhere, but can’t let go — because the ego refuses to start from zero.  
- A researcher who subconsciously **filters out contradictory data** to protect their preferred conclusion.  
- A founder who believes they were *“chosen”* to build something — not from love for building, but because their ego needs a role to act out.

None of this is clarity.  
It’s **ego wearing a mask**.

I could reference ancient philosophy here, but instead I’ll point to someone contemporary: the writer known as **T.F. Monkey**.

In one of his reflections on *ego death*, he gives an example I’ll paraphrase:

A wretched-looking homeless man walks past two people.

One says: *“He should get a job.”*  
The other says: *“It’s his fault he ended up like this.”*

And the homeless man simply keeps walking.

That’s the lesson.

Ego death isn’t dramatic.  
It’s quiet. Silent. A subtraction.  
It’s the moment you stop performing for the world — and stop projecting meaning onto everything around you.

And when that happens, clarity appears.

With ego gone:
- You can discard a failed project because **truth matters more than pride**.  
- You build a company because you **love building**, not because you need a mythic destiny.  
- You stop caring about what others think — realizing most “judgment” is just a projection of their own insecurity.

I went through ego death myself. It wasn’t sudden. It took years.  
I never had a big ego, but I still had one — and when it dissolved, my thinking shifted.  
Not louder. **Clearer.**

Many confuse **confidence without ego** with **confidence driven by ego**.  
Outwardly they look similar.

But the difference is internal — it’s in the **force that moves you forward**.

If you ever reach a point where you move like that homeless man — simply walking, not reacting, not performing, not proving…

**…congratulations. You’ve made it.**

And if you’re curious, that book might help you on the path.  
Follow the wisdom, not the author.
