# LinkedIn Post Draft — Ego & Clarity (Vladimír Variant)
**Timestamp: 2025-11-26**

**You cannot have ego and clarity at the same time.**

Over the years, I noticed a pattern: when someone’s ego is loud, their perception becomes distorted — both internally and externally. It becomes harder to see life objectively.

I’ve seen it in many forms:

- A scientist who spent 10 years on a line of research that went nowhere, but can’t let go because the ego refuses to start from zero.  
- A researcher who subconsciously filters out data that contradicts their preferred result.  
- A founder who believes they were “chosen” to build something — not because they enjoy building, but because their ego demands a role to play.

None of this is clarity. It’s ego wearing a mask.

I could recommend ancient philosophy, but instead I’ll mention something contemporary: a modern writer who goes by the pseudonym **T.F. Monkey**.

In one of his reflections, he writes about *ego death*. He gives an example I’ll paraphrase:

A wretched-looking homeless man walks past two people.

One says: “He should get a job.”  
The other says: “It’s his fault he ended up like this.”

And the homeless man simply keeps walking.

That’s the lesson.

Ego death isn’t dramatic. It’s quiet. It’s the moment you stop performing for the world and stop projecting meaning onto everything around you.

And when you do that, clarity appears.

- You’re able to discard a failed project because truth matters more than pride.  
- You build a company because you love building — not because you think you’re the chosen one.  
- You stop caring about what people think, and realize most “judgment” is just projection of their own insecurity.

I went through ego death myself. It took years. I never had a big ego, but I still had one. When it dissolved, my thinking changed — not louder, just clearer.

Many people confuse “confidence without ego” and “confidence driven by ego.” Outwardly they look similar.

The difference is invisible from the outside. You only feel it inside — in the **force that moves you forward**.

If you ever reach a point where you move like that homeless man — simply walking, without reacting, without trying to prove anything…

…congratulations. You’ve made it.
