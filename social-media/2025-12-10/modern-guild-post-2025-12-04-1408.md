**An Anti-Corporate Corporation? Maybe. But I Call It a Modern Guild. — December 4, 2025, 14:08**

For years, I taught people how to gain leverage in the corporate world — how to navigate politics, increase their salary, and design a role that actually fits them.

Then a simple truth hit me:

**How could I teach people how to outsmart corporations… and then go build a typical corporation myself?**

No one would buy that. And authenticity matters more than any leadership tactic or framework.

So I made a decision early on: I’m not building a classic corporate environment where I sit at the top and everyone else fits into predefined boxes. It would go against everything I believe about work, people, and meaning.

## **My Alternative? A Modern Guild.**

### **1. Multi-role humans, not single-slot employees**
Everyone will have a primary role and at least one secondary role — something meaningful they choose.

A UX designer might also teach emotional empathy.
An engineer might mentor juniors.
A producer might run internal culture workshops.

People are not one-dimensional.

### **2. Micro-teams instead of giant departments**
I can’t (and don’t want to) lead thousands. So the architecture is built around **small, self-sustaining cells** — teams with autonomy and clarity.

### **3. Ownership replaces micromanagement**
I expect people to lead themselves. That eliminates many candidates — but we have 8 billion people to choose from. Finding 100 high-ownership individuals is not impossible.

### **4. Success = decades of loyalty, not quarterly revenue**
This company is for-profit, but it’s not profit-maximizing. I optimize for:
- long-term mastery,
- internal satisfaction,
- and talent expression.

Revenue is the byproduct of coherence — not the target.

### **5. No KPIs. But we still measure energy flow.**
I’m allergic to KPI culture. But every living system needs to produce more energy than it consumes.

If someone underperforms, we talk. Maybe they’re misplaced. Maybe they need a new role. Or maybe this environment isn’t for them.

People either **grow** or **move on**.

### **6. The 'energy metric' is evolving**
Right now, I know I can lead ~10 people easily. As we scale, I adapt. The system adapts with me.

### **7. Big egos will exclude themselves naturally**
This architecture gives people nothing flashy to brag about quickly. There’s no instant status hit. Only those who endure will enjoy the fruits.

## **A Guild With Masters and Apprentices**
This is the company model I believe in — enough to dedicate my life to it.

It’s a new structure. A new rhythm of work. Maybe even a new category one day.

If it succeeds, maybe Harvard Business School studies it.
If it fails, I still had fun building something I believe in.

Either way — I refuse to build a corporation that looks like the ones I escaped.
