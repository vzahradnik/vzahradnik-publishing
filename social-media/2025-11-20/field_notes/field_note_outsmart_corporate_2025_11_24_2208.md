# **How to Outsmart the Corporate World: A Lesson in Sovereignty**

A year ago, I taught a small cohort-based course called **How to Outsmart the Corporate**.

Ten people.  
Zero marketing.  
Free of charge.

All I wanted was feedback — and I got plenty.

You’ve never heard of this course because I refused to run funnels, fake urgency, countdown timers, or any of the standard “guru” tactics. I put it aside intentionally.

I prefer to teach only when I meet people who are aligned, not desperate.

From the name alone, it might sound like a rebellious siege against the corporate world.  
In reality, it was something very different.

Over the years, I learned how to navigate corporations **without losing myself**.

The breakthrough came when I reframed employment as:

> *"I am exchanging the most precious asset I have — my finite time — for money."*

When you see it this way, you start valuing yourself properly.

The essence of the course was simple:

## 🔹 Sovereignty at work.

We all have to work — that part is non-negotiable.
But **how you work**, and **what you negotiate for**, is entirely up to you.

Most jobs revolve around three currencies:

➡️ **Money**  
➡️ **Time**  
➡️ **Fulfillment**

If you have all three: congratulations — you’ve won the corporate lottery.  
If you have two: that’s a decent job.  
If you have only one — or less — it’s time to reconsider your path.

---

While preparing the material, I realized that my own situation at the time wasn’t ideal either.

I had the **income**.  
I wasn’t **overworking**.  
But I had lost **fulfillment**.

So earlier this year, after mutual agreement, I left the project.

Time has proven that everything we covered in that course — including the acceleration of AI — was correct.  
And the need for **sovereignty** has only increased.

I believe I have a system that can dramatically increase your job stability.

But here’s the truth many people don’t want to hear:

> **No one can do the hard part for you.**

The real protection in today’s world isn’t a job title or a certificate.
It’s **creativity**, **original thinking**, and the return of the **modern generalist** —

the line that connects **da Vinci**, **Elon Musk**,  
… and yes, people wired like me.

If this resonates and you want to learn more,  
**my DMs are open.**
