A year ago I taught a small cohort-based course called How to Outsmart the Corporate.
Ten people. Zero marketing. Free of charge.
All I wanted was feedback — and I got plenty.

You’ve never heard of this course because I refused to run funnels, fake urgency, countdown timers, or any of the standard “guru” tactics. I put it aside intentionally.
I prefer to teach only when I meet people who are aligned, not desperate.

From the name alone it might sound like a rebellious siege against the corporate world.
In reality, it was something very different.

Over the years I learned how to navigate corporations without losing myself.
The breakthrough was reframing employment as:

“I’m exchanging the most precious asset I have — my finite time — for money.”

When you see it this way, you start valuing yourself properly.

The essence of the course was simple:

🔹 Sovereignty at work.

We all have to work. That part is non-negotiable.
But how you work — and what you negotiate for — is entirely up to you.

Most jobs revolve around three currencies:

➡️ Money
➡️ Time
➡️ Fulfillment

If you have all three: congratulations, you’ve won the corporate lottery.
If you have two: that’s a decent job.
If you have only one — or less — it’s time to reconsider your path.

While preparing the material, I realized that my own situation at the time wasn’t ideal either.
I had the income.
I wasn’t overworking.
But I had lost fulfillment.
So earlier this year, after mutual agreement, I left the project.

Time has proven that everything we covered in that course — including the acceleration of AI — was correct.
And the need for sovereignty has only increased.

I believe I have a system that can dramatically increase your job stability.
But here is the truth many people don’t want to hear:

No one can do the hard part for you.

The real protection in today’s world isn’t a job title or a certificate.
It’s creativity, original thinking, and the return of the modern generalist —
the line that connects da Vinci, Elon Musk… and yes, people wired like me.

If this resonates and you want to learn more,
my DMs are open.
