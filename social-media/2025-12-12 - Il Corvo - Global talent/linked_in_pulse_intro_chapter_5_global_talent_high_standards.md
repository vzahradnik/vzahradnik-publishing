**Chapter 5 is live.**

Today I’m releasing **Chapter 5 of the Il Corvo series** on LinkedIn Pulse:

**Global Talent, High Standards — Hiring for a Modern Guild**

This chapter is not about hiring tactics, perks, or scaling headcount.
It’s about something deeper:

— why geography is no longer a valid constraint,
— why small, autonomous teams outperform large hierarchies,
— and why I’m building a *guild*, not a company.

I’m not interested in building an HQ-centered organization.
I’m building a system where rare outliers — wherever they live — can grow into masters.

Remote-first is the default.
Physical presence is optional — but powerful.

If you’ve ever felt **too big for your local environment**, this chapter is for you.

*Il Corvo is a long-form exploration of leadership, sovereignty, and modern organizational design. This is not content for everyone — and that’s intentional.*
