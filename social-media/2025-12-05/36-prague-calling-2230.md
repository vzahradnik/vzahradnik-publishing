**Prague Calling — Draft Post (December 4, 2025, 22:30)**

Prague calling.

This weekend is different — no business meetings, no consulting mindset, no networking calendar. Even my friends will be surprised to read this. I came to Prague for a reason, and I can hardly spare a moment. We’ll catch up next year — I promise.

Tonight, I’m standing in a place that shaped history:  
**The Estates Theatre.**  
Where Mozart conducted.  
Where Miloš Forman filmed *Amadeus*.  
And where the 5th of December — the anniversary of Mozart’s death — carries a quiet electricity.

For me, this moment is as powerful as when tangueros make their pilgrimage to Buenos Aires. Some places are more than places — they are **coordinates where art, genius, and myth converge**.

And I have a tiny story that brought me here.

Two years ago, on this exact date, I was coming home from a business trip to Brno. My Notino contract had just ended — a symbolic closure — and I decided to stop in Bratislava for *La Traviata*.

I sat down, waiting for the opera to begin. A couple arrived and took the two seats next to me.

I said *„Dobrý deň.“*  
They smiled — and answered in English.

**Rosemary and Mark.**  
Two software engineers, both former Microsoft, both with stories from Silicon Valley before settling in Florida.

We ended up talking the entire intermission and half of the next act — about art, engineering, life, and serendipity. And it was Mark who casually mentioned:

*“You know… today is Mozart’s death anniversary.”*

That one sentence stuck with me.

We met only once.  
We’ve never spoken since.  
But somehow, they’re part of the reason I’m here tonight.

So here’s to serendipity.  
To the moments that stay with us.  
And to giving yourself enough space to follow them when they call.

Enjoy your weekend.  
Work can wait.
