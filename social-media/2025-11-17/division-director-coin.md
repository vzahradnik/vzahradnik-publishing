This coin was a gift — but not the ordinary kind.
It was given to me for leading people in crisis.

In July 2023, I accepted the role of Division Director in Toastmasters.
I expected bureaucracy, budgeting, two conferences, and the usual leadership routines.

But my division was different:

10 clubs in Slovakia.
9 clubs in Ukraine.
Yes — during an active war.

From day one, I knew I couldn’t be a “paper director.”
I wrote personal emails to my two Area Directors before we even met.
We formed a team under pressure — and pressure makes diamonds.

My priority was clear:

Hold the community together.
Protect Ukrainian (and Slovak) clubs from unnecessary bureaucracy.
Give people stability when everything else was unstable.

Sometimes I had to bend rules up to the edge.
But we made it work.

In war, people need light.

Toastmasters was that light.

I attended their meetings in English, week after week.
And while Ukrainians didn’t say it directly,
their appreciation was felt — unmistakably — in their presence, trust, and the way they showed up despite everything happening around them.

Then came our first division conference.

Early that morning:
“Bombs are falling on Kyiv.”
Message from my Area Directors.

We improvised instantly.

The first half of the conference ran online.
Some people joined from taxis — on mobile networks — because they had no power.
When it was safe again, they moved to the physical venue and we continued.

No delays.
No complaints.
No excuses.

Just resilience.

I won’t lie — sometimes I wanted to give up.
This role cost me an enormous amount of energy.
But I stayed because people needed leadership, not titles.

And at the end of the year, a district officer placed this coin in my hand.

Integrity.
Respect.
Service.
Excellence.

These aren’t buzzwords to me.
They are lived experience — earned with a team that held together through chaos.

On my résumé, my roles look purely technical.
On paper, I have “no leadership experience.”

In reality, I led 19 clubs through a crisis and kept communities alive.

I can’t transfer my personality to you —
but I can teach the structures, systems, and principles that make leadership work in the real world.

If you want leadership that actually holds under pressure,
let’s talk.
