Distinguished Toastmaster (DTM) is the highest recognition in Toastmasters.
In Slovakia, fewer than 5% ever reach it. It takes years of work and every person who earns it is a proven leader.

I’m close to finishing mine.

One of the requirements is coaching a struggling club. Most people choose an easy one — a club that just needs a bit of visibility to grow.

But as a Division Director, I deliberately chose hard mode.

I volunteered to coach an Ukrainian club in crisis.

Before the war, Chamber Toastmasters Club in Kyiv was one of the strongest clubs in the country — a President’s Distinguished Club with dozens of members.

– When I arrived, what I saw was a relic of its former strength.
– Many members had fled permanently
– Some moved to Norway
– Others to the USA
– Some to Saudi Arabia
– Officers were burned out
– The community was fractured
– The old meeting format no longer worked


It was clear:
the old club was gone — but a new one could be born.

The president, Liubov, refused to be the final president in the history of Ukraine’s oldest Toastmasters club.
She was the last anchor — but she couldn’t rebuild the club alone.

I told her the truth:
“We must transform completely. If we cling to the past, we won’t survive.”

We shifted the club into an online English-speaking format with Ukrainian roots.
We redesigned meetings from amateur to exceptional.
We rebuilt the officer team.
We recruited new members.
I used my Division Director influence to bring in one or two key people — because crisis teams are built around linchpins, not masses.

And slowly…
the club came back to life.

Some people left, unhappy with the new order.
But new people came — aligned, energized, committed.

A year and a half later:

Chamber Toastmasters Kyiv is not just stable.
It is thriving.
It regained President’s Distinguished status.
The transformation is complete.

Slavic roots intact.
International audience growing.
Identity restored.

This was my first coaching role where I wasn’t the one acting, but guiding leaders to act.
A new experience — and a powerful one.

Some people choose easy challenges.
I always choose doom mode.
That’s where growth is.

When I earn my DTM, this is the story that will echo behind that title.

I’ve already moved on to rebuild other communities — but Chamber continues to thrive, and we remain in contact.
