# **Bootstrap or Raise VC? My Take After Multiple Startup Failures**
**Originally published on LinkedIn (reformatted for zahradnik.io / Medium)**

Should you **bootstrap** your company or **raise venture capital**?  
I can’t answer for you — but I can share what my own journey taught me.

I haven’t yet built my “successful startup,” but I’ve already lived through several **failed ones**. Those failures became one of the best education cycles of my life.

All of them were **bootstrapped**.  
And here’s why:

- I didn’t leave the corporate world just to report to a new board in a different building.  
- Securing aligned investors takes months of pitching and paperwork. I prefer building over forecasting.  
- Even aligned co-founders often slowed the momentum.  
- I’m not building for a 5-year exit — I’m building something meant to outlive me.  
- Vision dilutes proportionally to the number of people who have a say in it.

When you take investor money, you’re not free.  
You just accepted a **fancier job** — one where the boss wears a Patagonia vest and tracks KPIs in spreadsheets.

And that’s fine for some founders.  
It’s just not me.

I’d rather go **slower**, but on **my terms**.

Over the years, one leadership rule proved itself again and again:

> **Listen broadly. Decide sovereignly.**

You are the captain.  
If you act like the captain, you may burn yourself occasionally — but long-term, sovereignty is the only strategy that compounds.

This pattern isn’t new. Consider:

- **Guido van Rossum**, creator of Python — the original “benevolent dictator for life.”  
- **Linus Torvalds**, creator of Linux and Git — two tools that quietly reshaped the world.

Both built slowly.  
Both built without chasing money.  
Both built with sovereignty.

So the real question is not “bootstrap or VC?”

It’s this:

**Do you want to build something fast and shallow?  
Or something slow that actually shifts society?**
