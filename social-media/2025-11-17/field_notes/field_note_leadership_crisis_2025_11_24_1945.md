# **Leadership That Holds Under Pressure**

This coin was a gift — but not the ordinary kind.  
It was given to me for **leading people in crisis**.

In July 2023, I accepted the volunteer role of **Division Director** in Toastmasters. I expected the usual: some bureaucracy, budgeting, two conferences, and a predictable leadership cycle.

But my division was different.

**10 clubs in Slovakia.  
9 clubs in Ukraine.  
Yes — during an active war.**

From day one, I knew I couldn’t be a *"paper director"*. I wrote personal emails to my Area Directors before we ever met. We formed a team under pressure — and pressure makes diamonds.

My priority was simple:

- Hold the community together.  
- Protect Ukrainian (and Slovak) clubs from unnecessary bureaucracy.  
- Give people stability when everything else was unstable.

Sometimes I bent rules right up to the edge.  
But we made it work.

In war, people need **light**.  
Toastmasters was that light.

I attended Ukrainian meetings in English, week after week.  
Their gratitude was never spoken directly — it was felt.  
In their presence.  
In their trust.  
In the way they kept showing up despite everything happening around them.

Then came our first division conference.

Early in the morning, I received a message:

> *“Bombs are falling on Kyiv.”*

We improvised instantly.

- The first half of the conference ran online.
- Some people joined from taxis — on mobile networks — because they had no power.
- When it was safe again, they moved to the physical venue and we continued.

No delays.  
No complaints.  
No excuses.

Just **resilience**.

I won’t lie — sometimes I wanted to give up. This role cost enormous energy.  
But I stayed because people didn’t need titles.  
They needed **leadership**.

And at the end of the year, a district officer placed a coin in my hand.

**Integrity.  
Respect.  
Service.  
Excellence.**

These aren’t buzzwords.  
They were lived — earned with a team that held together through chaos.

---

On my résumé, my roles look purely technical.  
On paper, I have *“no leadership experience.”*

But in reality, I led **19 clubs through a crisis** — and helped keep communities alive.

I can’t transfer my personality to you.  
But I can teach the **structures**, **systems**, and **principles** that make leadership work in the real world.

If you want leadership that actually holds under pressure,  
**let’s talk.**
