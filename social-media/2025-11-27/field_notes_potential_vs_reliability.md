**Potential is cheap. Reliability is priceless.**

Over the past seven years in the non-profit world, hundreds of people have passed through my hands — protégés, peers, fellow officers.  
One pattern became impossible to ignore: **I’m exceptionally good at spotting potential.**

Sometimes a few minutes with a person is enough for me to see:
- *“This guy could be a CTO one day.”*  
- *“He’s in his 20s, already working two contracts in parallel.”*  
- *“Despite hating corporate life, he still delivers.”*

This particular guy is real — and he’s on a very strong trajectory.  
I hope to have him in my company one day.

But there’s another side to the story.

I’ve met **extremely bright people** who barely get by financially.  
Genius-level IQ, yet burdened by:
- inner instability,  
- fractured mind,  
- cycles of self-sabotage,  
- emotional volatility.

They inherited **incredible hardware**… but often at a cost.

And don’t get me wrong — I *love* having such people around me.  
One of my long-term visions is to build a company that gives outliers a real chance: a place that shields them from unnecessary chaos and lets their brilliance shine.

But here’s the realization that hit me hardest over the years:

> **👉 Potential is cheap.**

Thousands of people are brilliant.  
Many of my friends have the potential to become millionaires — but they don’t.

They run in loops.  
They move slowly.  
Sometimes they don’t move at all.

Meanwhile, others — equally smart but more grounded — simply rise.  
They are humble, stable, integrated.  
And they quietly climb to the top while the “geniuses” burn out.

Just look at **Ray Kroc vs. the McDonald brothers**.  
Visionaries often stay stuck.  
Operators win.

Because at the end of the day:

**It’s not genius alone that wins the game.**  
**It’s persistence.**  
**It’s stability.**  
**It’s integration.**  
**It’s being someone people can count on.**

**Reliability is the true superpower.**
