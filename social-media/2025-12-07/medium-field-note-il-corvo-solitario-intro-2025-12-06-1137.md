# The Prelude to Il Corvo Solitario — LinkedIn Edition

For the next several days, I’m switching into a fully entrepreneurial mode.

This is a short prelude — a signal for those who follow my work across technology, leadership, and organizational design. What comes next is not a random series of thoughts, but a structured introduction to a new organizational operating system.

One that combines:
- the *leadership excellence* found in healthy non-profit systems, and
- the *sustainable, disciplined structure* found in well-run for-profit companies.

This model has been maturing in my mind for years, but between May and September 2025 — during a period of deep work — it finally crystallized. It is modular, concise, and adaptable: you don’t need to adopt all of it to benefit from parts of it.

Over the next week, I will share the pillars of this system. Each post will stand alone, but together they form a complete architecture.

If you follow me for engineering content, thank you for your patience — we return to it soon. And you may be surprised how much computer science quietly influenced the structure of this system.

If you’re a founder or leader, consider this an invitation. Even a fraction of this model — implemented with intention — can materially elevate how your organization operates.

**Il Corvo Solitario — LinkedIn Edition begins tomorrow.**
