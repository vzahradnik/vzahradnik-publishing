**My proposal of a new organizational operating system**  
**December 6, 2025, 11:20**

Dear community,

Starting tomorrow, I am switching into a fully entrepreneurial mode. For the next several days, I will introduce my proposal for a modern organizational operating system — one that, in my view, combines the best of the non-profit leadership model with the clarity, sustainability, and discipline of for-profit business.

This vision has been maturing for years, but it crystallized between May and September 2025 when I worked on it full-time — often late into the night. The model is modular, concise, and applicable even in fragments. You don’t need to adopt all of it to benefit from it.

Each post in the coming week will highlight a different pillar of the system so you can gradually assemble the bigger picture.

If you follow me primarily for tech content, I ask for a bit of patience. We will return to engineering and product work after this short sequence — and you may still find these insights useful. Several ideas were inspired by computer science and adapted into organizational design.

If you are a founder or leader, consider this an invitation: **even small parts of this model can materially improve how your organization functions.** My DMs are open if you want to explore it privately.

Without further ado, allow me to introduce **Il Corvo Solitario — LinkedIn Edition.** The first chapter arrives tomorrow.
