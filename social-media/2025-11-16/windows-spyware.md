Microsoft Windows was never the best system — but for many years, it was good enough. It worked, it stayed mostly out of the way, and it didn’t interfere with how you wanted to use your computer.

But products eventually become reflections of the companies behind them.

And the Windows of today reflects a very different Microsoft.

Windows has shifted from being an operating system into being a funnel for analytics, services, identity layers, and aggressive cloud attachment. In my view, Windows 11 crossed a line.

Yesterday I was updating my dad’s PC.
The moment you refuse to sign in to OneDrive, Windows responds with:

– a large error message on the desktop
– Windows Defender warning that the system is “at risk”
– repeated attempts to steer you back into the cloud


Yet the only real “risk” is the operating system itself — trying to behave like a platform you never asked for.

I’ve been a Linux user for years, but I drifted back to Windows because clients required obscure VPNs, corporate software, or Teams. Over time, I spent more hours in Windows than Linux… until I removed Linux entirely.

Windows 11 changed that.

This time the shift is conscious and permanent:
Windows will not be allowed on my machines or in my company unless there is a very specific, unavoidable, industry-grade reason.

Not out of ideology — but out of sovereignty.

I want my systems to serve me, not the other way around.

My path back to technological freedom has begun.
And I’m building a business on these principles as well.

Sovereignty starts small.
Will you join?
