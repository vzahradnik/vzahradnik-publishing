# **When Operating Systems Stop Serving Users**

Microsoft Windows was never the *best* operating system — but for many years, it was **good enough**. It worked, stayed mostly out of the way, and didn’t interfere with how you wanted to use your machine.

But products eventually become **reflections of the companies behind them**.

And the Windows of today reflects a very different Microsoft.

Windows has shifted from being an operating system into being a **funnel** for:
- analytics,
- services,
- identity layers,
- aggressive cloud attachment.

In my view, Windows 11 crossed a line.

Yesterday, while updating my dad’s PC, I saw the shift clearly.

The moment you refuse to sign in to OneDrive, Windows responds with:
- a large error message pinned to the desktop,
- Windows Defender claiming the system is *"at risk"*,
- repeated attempts to steer you back into the cloud.

Yet the only real **risk** is the operating system itself — trying to behave like a platform you never asked for.

I’ve been a Linux user for years, but I drifted back to Windows because clients required:
- obscure VPNs,
- proprietary corporate tools,
- and, of course, Teams.

Gradually I found myself spending more hours in Windows than Linux… until I removed Linux entirely.

Windows 11 changed that.

This time the decision is conscious and permanent:

> Windows will not be allowed on my machines or in my company unless there is a very specific, unavoidable, industry-grade reason.

This isn’t about ideology.  
It’s about **sovereignty**.

I want my systems to serve **me**, not the other way around.

My path back to technological freedom has begun.  
And I’m building a business on the same principles.

Sovereignty starts small.  
**Will you join?**
