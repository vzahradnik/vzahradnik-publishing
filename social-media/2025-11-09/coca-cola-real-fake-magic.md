Coca-Cola: Real Fake Magic

No, I’m not after Coca-Cola.
It wasn’t my plan to post again about their Christmas AI commercial — but something interesting is happening behind the scenes.

Official statements described the ad as “a revolution in storytelling.”
Critics were dismissed as “artists afraid of losing their jobs.”
Coca-Cola even compared their AI work to Hollywood-grade animation.

But that’s not what the public saw.

The first version of the ad — released just a few days ago — was a 1:18-minute AI-generated video. The response was overwhelmingly negative: blurred details, morphing trucks, uncanny characters.

Now, if you open Coca-Cola’s official YouTube channel, that version is gone.
In its place, you’ll find a shorter 1-minute cut using the same video ID and analytics.

Normally, YouTube doesn’t allow anyone to replace a video while keeping stats and engagement history. Only a handful of global corporations have that privilege — and Coca-Cola is one of them.

So instead of acknowledging the misfire, they simply replaced the evidence and carried on.

This is not about Coca-Cola’s brand. It’s about a deeper question:
👉 What happens when “AI storytelling” meets corporate revisionism?

The future of marketing might not be fake ads.
It might be real ads rewritten silently.
