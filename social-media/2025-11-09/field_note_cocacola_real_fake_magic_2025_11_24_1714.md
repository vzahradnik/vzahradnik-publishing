# **Coca-Cola’s AI Ad: Real Magic or Real Revisionism?**
**Originally published on LinkedIn (reformatted for zahradnik.io / Medium)**

Coca-Cola called their new Christmas AI commercial a *“revolution in storytelling.”*  
Critics were dismissed as *“artists afraid of losing their jobs.”*  
Some statements even compared the spot to **Hollywood-grade animation**.

But that’s not what the public saw.

The original video — a **1:18-minute AI-generated ad** — was filled with visual artifacts:

- blurred background details,
- morphing trucks,
- uncanny character movement.

Feedback was overwhelmingly negative.

And then something unusual happened.

### **The video disappeared — but the stats didn’t**
If you visit Coca-Cola’s official YouTube channel now, that original version is gone.  
In its place is a **shorter, 1-minute cut**.

But here’s the interesting part:

Coca-Cola kept the **same video ID**, the same **analytics**, and the same **engagement history**.

Normally, YouTube does **not** allow this.  
You cannot replace a video and keep its stats.

Only a handful of global corporations have that privilege.  
Coca-Cola is one of them.

Instead of acknowledging the misfire, they simply **replaced the evidence**.

### **This isn’t about Coca-Cola. It’s about the future.**
The deeper question is this:

👉 **What happens when “AI storytelling” meets corporate revisionism?**

We often worry about *fake* ads.  
But the future of marketing might be something subtler — and more powerful:

**Real ads rewritten silently.**
