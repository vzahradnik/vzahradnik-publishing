**Chapter 4 — Why I Don’t Claim the CEO/Founder Title… Yet**

People often ask me why, despite clearly building something, I don’t call myself a CEO or Founder on LinkedIn. The short answer: it feels too soon.

Over the years I’ve watched how titles inflate, how everyone becomes a "CEO" of a one‑person company, and how status labels sometimes replace actual work. Instead of joining the title theatre, I decided to approach things differently.

Last night — around 3 AM, where the best ideas tend to emerge — I gave myself a new working title:

**Mädchen für alles.**

A small joke, yes. But also a reminder that at this early stage I truly *do* everything: building structures, writing doctrine, designing systems, thinking across domains, and cleaning up whatever needs to be done. It’s honest, practical, and a little playful.

Tomorrow I’ll share a longer reflection on titles, ego, and why I believe modern companies could benefit from more creativity and less rigidity in how we define roles. Especially when designing a new type of organization.

If you’ve ever wanted to invent your own job title — something more human, more accurate, or simply more fun — tomorrow’s article is for you.

Stay tuned.
