## Do you actually own your IP?
As a founder, I treat my company name as a core asset — not a decoration. It carries the story, the mission, and years of my life. Losing it or being forced to rebrand is simply not an option.

Yesterday I submitted an EU-wide trademark application, and here’s what I learned:

**Most founders ignore their IP until it’s too late.** Some assume “nobody will copy me now,” others delegate the process to law firms that charge a premium but still don’t understand the product as deeply as the founder does.

**The truth is simple:** It’s far easier (and cheaper) to protect your brand while you’re invisible than to fight for it once you become visible.

I registered a **word mark** — the strongest form of protection. Logos and visuals can come later; the name must be defensible today.

Here’s the best part: Through the **EUIPO SME Fund**, SMEs can receive **up to 75% reimbursement**. Applying for the voucher costs nothing except time. Only after approval do you proceed with the actual trademark filing.

For me, the process took:
- ~7 hours of work
- **€1500 upfront**
- **€350 net** after reimbursement

For a 10-year, EU-wide, durable protection — that’s an excellent deal.

To illustrate why this matters, I looked at a well-known Slovak company in the fitness space (no names — this isn’t about calling anyone out). Their **logos** are protected, but the **name itself** is not. It’s a blind spot even successful companies have.

A competitor could theoretically register the word mark first, and the original brand would face years of unnecessary legal and financial headaches.

**Takeaway for founders:**
**Protect your assets early.** Especially now, when the EU literally pays you to do it.
