**Is it possible to build a unicorn without the grind? Maybe…**

Recently I stumbled upon a VC/incubator looking for *rare outlier founders* who can “change the world.” Naturally, this resonated with me — because I’m building something similar in spirit.

But after reading their application FAQ, I realized something surprising: **I’m an outlier even for them.**

One section said (paraphrased):
> *“Are you ready to grind for the next 10 years? To sacrifice your friends, your time, your life? If not, please do not apply.”*

So I didn’t apply.

Because here’s the truth:

Yes — if your aim is to reach a billion-dollar valuation in 5 years, you will grind. There is no way around that. The physics of hyper-growth demand it.

But if you remove the artificial 5-year horizon… if you allow the company to grow organically, sustainably… if you value **longevity over speed**…

Then maybe — just maybe — a unicorn *without grind* is possible.

I want to lead teams of brilliant people and build something with real impact. But I’m not willing to sacrifice my life to do it. Not for an optional “chance” at becoming one of the few hyper-growth founders.

My vision is different:

A sustainable modern guild.
Semi-autonomous teams.
A company that scales through clarity, not burnout.
Where my role is to direct energy — like a maestro conducting an orchestra.

My timeline is not 5 years. It’s 30.

I don’t know how far I’ll go or how fast. But the system already works: I have a small circle of collaborators, the culture is alive, and I still have a life outside of work.

If this resonates with you… maybe our paths will cross. And maybe one day we’ll build something together — without the grind.
