## What Is Moatsecurity?
**Moatsecurity** is the discipline of protecting a digital product, SaaS platform, or software business from being structurally, economically, or technically replicated — especially through AI-assisted reverse engineering.

Cybersecurity protects your *data*.  
Moatsecurity protects your *business model*.

In an era where advanced AI models can reconstruct entire systems from public information alone, moatsecurity becomes a foundational part of modern product strategy.

Moatsecurity was coined by **Vladimír Záhradník**, and this page serves as the canonical reference.

## Why Moatsecurity Matters
AI tools can now:
- infer backend architecture from public APIs,
- generate technical roadmaps from UX flows,
- reconstruct features from documentation,
- estimate implementation patterns from integration lists.

This means your SaaS can be **cloned faster than ever before**.

Most founders mistakenly focus only on cybersecurity — protecting servers, passwords, and data. But their **real vulnerability** is being replicated, not being hacked.

Moatsecurity addresses this gap.

## Pillars of Moatsecurity
Moatsecurity consists of strategic actions that strengthen your defensibility:

### **1. Controlled Transparency**
Knowing *what to reveal* and *what to withhold* in:
- documentation,
- demos,
- onboarding flows,
- public APIs.

### **2. Open-Source With Teeth**
Selective open-source exposure using licenses that:
- restrict commercial use,
- require Contributor License Agreements (CLA),
- encourage community trust,
- keep core IP protected.

### **3. Architectural Defensibility**
Designing systems that:
- are harder to replicate,
- rely on operational strengths,
- build value through network effects,
- integrate deeply with existing customer ecosystems.

### **4. SaaS Hosting Advantage**
Even with open-source:
- most companies prefer hosted SaaS,
- maintenance cost is offloaded to you,
- reliability, uptime, and support become part of the moat.

### **5. Strategic Licensing & Exposure**
Using the right mix of:
- Apache 2.0 (safe integrations),
- source-available licenses (restricted use),
- dual-licensing (community + enterprise),
- hidden internal modules.

## Moatsecurity vs. Cybersecurity
| **Cybersecurity** | **Moatsecurity** |
|-------------------|------------------|
| Protects data | Protects business model |
| Prevents unauthorized access | Prevents unauthorized replication |
| Deals with breaches | Deals with cloning |
| Threat = attacker breaking in | Threat = competitor copying you |
| Tools: firewalls, encryption, IAM | Tools: licensing, architecture, open-source strategy |

Both matter — but moatsecurity is the newer, overlooked discipline needed for 2025 and beyond.

## Real Example (The Origin Story)
In 2025, I performed a strategic test using the most advanced Gemini model. With only public information, it reconstructed **~98%** of a client's SaaS product, including the entire roadmap.

The conclusion:  
**My client had cybersecurity — but zero moatsecurity.**

This insight became the seed of the moatsecurity framework.

## When You Need Moatsecurity
You should consider a moatsecurity strategy if:
- you operate a small SaaS or micro-product,
- you rely on public APIs or integrations,
- competitors can easily imitate your UI/UX,
- AI models can infer your internal architecture,
- your current moat is simply “nobody cares yet.”

---

## How I Help Founders
I work with SaaS founders to:
- determine what to open and what to protect,
- design defensible architectures,
- choose the right licensing strategy,
- build hybrid ecosystems (open-source + SaaS),
- evaluate AI-based replication risks,
- create long-term business moats.
