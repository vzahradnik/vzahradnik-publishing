This is one of the strongest posts in my archive.
I wrote it almost seven years ago — and reading it today feels like meeting my past self again. Some of the insights held surprisingly well. A few even materialized into real products.

If I were writing this post today, I would title it differently:

“A successful startup? Focus on boring business.”

Because in hindsight, the truth is simple:
– Boring markets are more predictable
– They’re less saturated
– Customers actually need the product
– Investors love them because they carry less risk

You may not “make a dent in the universe,” but you build something that works — and something that funds your freedom.

Boring business means fuel.
And once you have fuel, you can build whatever your heart wants.

If you're building or thinking of building, this post may give you a few ideas — and a glimpse into how I was thinking back then.

Happy reading.
Happy building.
