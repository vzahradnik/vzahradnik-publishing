There are three kinds of people when it comes to CliftonStrengths by Gallup:

1. Those who never heard of it.
2. Those who argue with the results.
3. And those who are so aligned that the test simply confirms what they already know.


I’m the third category.

When a friend told me about the test, I didn’t spend months hesitating. I bought it, took it immediately, and waited to see what it reveals. After she saw my Top 10, she just smiled and said: “Expected. Learners always want to know.”

She later introduced me to her friend from Silicon Valley — also a Learner at the top. When we met on Zoom, it felt like reconnecting with someone I’d known for a long time.

But this post isn’t about curiosity.

It’s about my #2 trait: Restorative — the strength that has shaped my entire professional identity.

I thrive in chaos. Stability feels… boring. This is why I’m excellent at starting things and less optimal for maintaining them in a perfectly steady state.

This pattern follows me everywhere:

– I saved two Toastmasters clubs that were on the edge of collapse.
– I kept an entire division functioning during wartime, including nine Ukrainian clubs.
– I stepped into situations that were challenging, unclear, or near-failure — and I savored the work.


Here’s what I’ve learned about myself:

I naturally gravitate toward projects, systems, or organizations that are one step away from thriving — but stuck. That missing 10–20%? I see it instantly.

A product with huge potential but poor positioning.
A team with talent but no structure.
A company that could scale but lacks one decisive shift.

My instinct is always the same: Fix what is broken — if people let me.

Sometimes the system is beyond repair.
But in many cases a few strategic interventions completely change the trajectory.

You can hire consultants who will optimize funnels, tune ads, or polish your brand.
But if your company is struggling, if something fundamental feels “off,”
fractional advice won’t save you.

What I do is different:

I look at your product, system, or organizational dynamics as a whole.
I identify what’s leaking.
I show what must be fixed.
And I prioritize the steps in the right order.

I cannot save every organization.
But I can often give it the one insight it desperately needs.

Or, to quote Jerry Maguire:
