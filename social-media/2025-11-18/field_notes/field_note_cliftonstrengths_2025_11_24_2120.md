# **What CliftonStrengths Revealed About My Work in Chaos**

There are three kinds of people when it comes to **CliftonStrengths by Gallup**:

1. Those who have never heard of it.  
2. Those who argue with the results.  
3. Those who are so aligned that the test simply confirms what they already know.

I’m the third category.

When a friend told me about the test, I didn’t hesitate.  
I bought it immediately, took it, and waited for the results.  
After seeing my Top 10, she just smiled:

> *“Expected. Learners always want to know.”*

Later, she introduced me to her friend from Silicon Valley — also a **Learner** at the top.  
When we met on Zoom, it felt like reconnecting with someone I’d known for years.

But this post isn’t about curiosity.

It’s about my **#2 trait: Restorative** — the strength that has shaped my entire professional identity.

I thrive in **chaos**.  
Stability feels… boring.

This is why I’m excellent at **starting** things, and less optimal at maintaining them in a perfectly steady state.

This pattern follows me everywhere:

- I saved two Toastmasters clubs on the edge of collapse.
- I kept an entire division functioning during wartime, including **nine Ukrainian clubs**.
- I stepped into situations that were challenging, unclear, or near-failure — and I *savored* the work.

Here’s what I’ve learned about myself:

I naturally gravitate toward projects, systems, or organizations that are **one step away from thriving** — but stuck.  
That missing 10–20%? I see it instantly.

A product with potential but poor positioning.  
A team with talent but no structure.  
A company capable of scaling but missing one decisive shift.

My instinct is always the same:

> **Fix what is broken — if people let me.**

Sometimes the system is beyond repair.  
But often, a few strategic interventions completely change the trajectory.

You can hire consultants to tune funnels, polish ads, or refine your brand.  
But if your company is struggling — if something fundamental feels *off* — fractional advice won’t save you.

What I do is different:

- I look at your product, system, or organizational dynamics **as a whole**.  
- I identify what’s leaking.  
- I show what must be fixed.  
- And I prioritize the steps in the right order.

I cannot save every organization.  
But I can often give it the **one insight** it desperately needs.

Or, to quote Jerry Maguire:

> *“Help me help you.”*
