*Baby Boom* (1987) is one of my favourite films — not just for the story, but for the subtle entrepreneurial arc woven beneath the romance.

C.J. Wiatt is a high-performing professional working **80–90 hours a week**, weekends included. Her life revolves entirely around her career; she’s effectively married to her job. Her partner lives the same way — they share an apartment, not a life.

Everything changes when C.J. unexpectedly inherits a baby girl.  
Her structured world collapses. What follows is a complete **identity rupture**.

What makes the film timeless is what comes next.

C.J. is forced to slow down, reconnect with herself, rediscover her softness, and rebuild from the ground up. Out of **presence rather than pressure**, she creates a simple product — homemade apple juice — that grows into a business worth millions.

My favourite moment in the entire film is the final monologue.

After proving she can "have it all,” she is offered a huge sum of money to sell everything and return to her old life.

She refuses.

> *“I’m not selling.  
> I’m not one of you anymore.”*

For me, C.J. Wiatt is a reminder that we don’t need to grind ourselves into exhaustion to build something meaningful.

**Aligned creation beats perpetual hustle.  
Every time.**
